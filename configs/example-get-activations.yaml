cli: get-activations  # Required (str): which CLI this config is for


model: test  # Required (str)
dataset:
  name: trivia_qa  # Required (str)
  num_questions: 20  # Required (int or "all")
  skip: 0  # Optional (int): skip the first N questions. Total questions processed will be `num_questions - skip`
  shuffle: True  # Required (bool)
  seed: 42  # Optional (int or None): seed used to shuffle the dataset, ignored if shuffle is False
  # ids_file: ids.txt  # Optional (str): path to file containing question ids to index the dataset
                       # If used, num_questions, skip, shuffle and seed are ignored
                       # Integers in file can be separated by newlines, spaces or commas
results:
  # postfix: _part1  # Optional (str): postfix to append to results filenames
  dir:
    local: ./results  # Required (dir) if s3 is not specified, otherwise optional
    # s3: s3://YOUR-BUCKET/experiments/test/  # Required (s3 uri) if local is not specified, otherwise optional
  save_frequency: 6  # Optional (int): save results every N questions, otherwise only save at the end
  overwrite: False  # Required (bool): overwrite existing results.
                    # If False, will fail if any results already exist

forward_kwargs:  # Optional (dict): kwargs to pass to the model's forward method
  output_hidden_states: True

# Required (str): Python code to define which modules to hook and a hook function
# Code will be run with `exec` in the CLI
# `modules_to_hook` is required, and should be list[str] with valid module paths
# `fwd_hook_function` is requirs `module_path=None` and `store=None` as kwargs
# `store` will be a defaultdict(list) used to pass on the activations you want to collect
# The .keys() of `store` will be used as the prefixes of resulting filenames
# All tensors MUST be moved to the CPU for pickling
# GOTCHA: when slicing a tensor, you should .clone(), otherwise you'll get a view and save the entire tensor
# Tip: you can `import re` and use regex to simplify layer-wise collection
